The iCORE newsletter highlights events and information related to the [innovation in COmputing REsearch (iCORE) lab](https://icore.tamucc.edu/),
as well as the broader GSCS/CS programs at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi and whatever else might interest that community.

## Welcome







## iCORE Meetings

**[iCORE Teams meeting link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3Ameeting_MDdlZDBiMTgtYzVjNS00YjhhLWE5OTctY2Y5YzMyYTljNzU5%40thread.v2/0?context=%7B%22Tid%22%3A%2234cbfaf1-67a6-4781-a9ca-514eb2550b66%22%2C%22Oid%22%3A%22994c008b-0707-4f3c-8ac0-73b65e733430%22%2C%22MessageId%22%3A%220%22%7D)**

### Previous Meeting: January 19, 3:00 - 5:00 PM

- Evan Krell presented a practice session of two machine learning course modules.
- These modules are part of the [AMS Short Course: Machine Learning in Python for Environmental Science Problems](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/education-careers/careers/professional-development/short-courses/machine-learning-in-python-for-environmental-science-problems2/)
- This is a day-long course that will be given at the upcoming [104th Annual Meeting of the American Meteorological Society](https://annual.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/2024/)
- Evan is presenting modules on: (1) data preprocessing and investigation, (2) eXplainable AI (XAI)
- The Colab notebooks for the course are [available here](https://github.com/ekrell/ams_ai_shortcourse_2024). They have been updated since the practice. 

### Next Meeting: February 9, 3:30 - 5:00 PM

- Because Dr. King & Evan are traveling for the next two weeks, the next meeting is in **three weeks**
- Goals:
  1. Plan out the Spring semester events
  2. General research updates from iCORE members
  3. Introduce new iCORE members & help them get involved

## Upcoming Events

### [104th Annual Meeting of the American Meteorological Society](https://annual.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/2024/)

- A very large group from TAMUCC (faculty, students, alumni) will be attending AMS 2024.
- These include members of iCORE and our closely associated lab: the [Coastal Dynamics Lab](https://www.coastaldynamicslab.org/).
- All of these are members of the [NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography (AI2ES)](https://www.ai2es.org/)
  - (or at least work closely with AI2ES on some projects)  

**NOAA CO-OPS Visit**

- Taking advantage of the opportunity, several of us are going to Baltimore early for a visit to NOAA CO-OPS in nearby Silver Spring, MD.
- Miranda White, Matthew Kastl, and Evan Krell will be giving lightning talks on our research.
- Marina Vicens-Miquel and Philippe Tissot will give longer presentations.

**AMS Short Course: Machine Learning in Python for Environmental Science Problems**

- The weekend before the main AMS conferences, there are several Short Course options.
- Hamid Kamangir & Evan Krell are two of the four instructors.
  - Hamid Kamangir is teaching: (1) Model Evaluation, (2) Transformers.
  - Evan Krell is teaching: (1) data preprocessing and investigation, (2) eXplainable AI (XAI).
- All course materials will be made available at this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ekrell/ams_ai_shortcourse_2024)
- I'm pretty sure that the instructors will get free lunch. :eyes:
