### 2023 UF + NVIDIA Hackathon

- Dr. Philippe Tissot and Evan Krell are participating in a [hackathon hosted by University of Florida (UF) and NVIDIA](https://news.it.ufl.edu/research/2023-ufnvidia-hackathon/).
- We are working remotely with a team of NOAA scientists to develop AI models for detecting when a water level reading is bad data.
- The focus of the hackathon is to work with mentors from NVIDIA to learn how to accelerate code and take advantage of HPC GPU resources.
- Evan's role is to adapt their existing model training and evaluation code and make it more suitable for running a very large number of jobs.
- Right now, we are learning how to use [NVIDIA Nsight Systems](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems) for GPU code profiling.
- We are also learning about strategies to store our large CSV data in a way that supports efficient loading on GPUs.
