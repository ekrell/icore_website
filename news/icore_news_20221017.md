# iCORE Newsletter - 2022/10/17

## News

Alexis Guijarro ([@alexis_guijarro](https://twitter.com/alexis_guijarro)) is a TAMUCC alumni with a masters in Computer Science who was very involved with iCORE. 
He is a co-organizer of an upcoming robotics workshop at the [Cumbre de Contribuidores de Open Source Software (CCOSS)](https://ccoss.org/), taking place from November 11 & 12 in Guadalajara, MÃ©xico. 
The workshop, [_Crea un robot repartidor open source con PX4 y ROS_](https://ccoss.org/crea-robot-repartidor-os-px4-ros/),
guides participants toward developing robot systems that leverage powerful tools and frameworks from the open source [PX4](https://px4.io/) and [ros](https://www.ros.org/) communities. After teaching robot fundamentals for an example delivery drone project, participants will learn how to make open source contributions and learn about the resources available for the Latin American open source community. 
Alexis is also giving a talk at CCOSS about [ros driver development](https://ccoss.org/sessions/2022/la-aventura-de-escribir-drivers-para-ros/). 
Alexis is a ros expert with substantial robotics experience including [multi-agent control of autonomous aerial vehicles](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1109%2FICUAS.2018.8453484&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2j89VTYvQmdO02_x6-gOBi) and using [human gestures to control aerial vehicles (with deep neural networks)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1007%2F978-3-030-40309-6_10&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0LH9jGTMu4nlp1lPcV1RI6).

## Previous events 

Last Friday (Oct 14), Evan Krell gave a workshop/tutorial on Linux for Researchers. The purpose was to provide solutions and guidance for questions and concerns that student researchers commonly have as they start working in a Linux environment. There was not a large crowd, but there were a lot of questions and interaction among participants so the workshop was successful. We were very pleased to have 2 attendees from [Del Mar](https://www.delmar.edu/) among us: always very welcome to iCORE events. Some brought their own list of Linux questions that we worked on together after. The workshop materials are available here: [https://github.com/ekrell/linux4research](https://github.com/ekrell/linux4research). The workshop will almost certainly be repeated in the future, hopefully to a wider audience. Even though we provide the material, much of the value is in the in-person discussion. 

## Upcoming events

The next scheduled iCORE workshop is on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The workshop is still in early development, but the plan is to be very hands-on. The Linux workshop was slightly challenging because not everyone has access to the same Linux resources, but we can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for the XAI material. Planned topics include (1) intro to XAI, (2) XAI pitfalls, and (3) interactive lab. Hopefully participants will work together to apply XAI to some machine learning models. 

The next iCORE bi-weekly meeting is this Thursday (Oct 20) at 3:30 pm at the NRC 2100 suite. Everyone is welcome to attend. We always share research updates, plan iCORE events, get feedback on ideas, etc. We would love to see people come who attended the iCORE Open House last month. This is a good way to connect with other iCORE members and get involved with projects. 

## Get involved

As always, we encourage all iCORE members and iCORE-adjacent persons to get involved and propose workshop/lecture/training ideas that they would like to present.
