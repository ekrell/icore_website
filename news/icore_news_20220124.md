## Happy New Year!

Last week, Evan Krell and iCORE alumni Laha Ale attempted to persuade Dr. King to give us red envelopes. Shockingly, he did not do it. 

This very week, Wen Zhong is working on her qualifying exams! **Fighting!!**

## Winter Break Conferences

**AGU**

**AMS**

Evan Krell had a mission in Denver: send a postcard to a certain someone back in Corpus. 
After purchasing a generic mountain landscape scene at the closest tacky suvenier shop, he realized something important.
Having never written a postcard before, what exactly was he supposed to write?
After all, he was here for a conference and the most exciting thing so far had been the jellyfish salad.
(Not bad, but he prefers chicken feet. So far, two Chinese students have mentioned cooking chicken feet for Evan and he is still waiting...)
Things took a turn after an ill-fated attempt at ice skating. 
During the ambulance ride to the emergency room, Evan realized that he had material for the postcard.
That night, with blood-stained sweater submerged in a a sink of cold water, he wrote the postcard. 
But the morning revealed another incident: the ink used smeared at the slightest touch. 
Evan took to the streets of Denver by means of electric scooter to purchase yet another postcard. 
Two in fact, in case of another disaster. 
By writing each stroke three or four times, the mechanical pencil's output was dark enough to be legible and the postcard was finally ready to be sent.
Evan was surprised when informed at the post office nearest to the conference that they were out of stamps. 
He walked roughly half an hour to a further post office whose parking lot was quite active with the sale of weed products. 
Finally, Evan purchased a stamp, applied it to the postcard, and dropped it off in the box. Self-service, just the way he likes it. 
Almost two weeks later, and the postcard's recipient reports that the card has not arrived.
Evan is never sending a postcard again. 



## Upcoming Events
