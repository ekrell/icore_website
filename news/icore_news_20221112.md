# iCORE Newsletter – 2022/11/12

The iCore newsletter highlights events and information related to the [innovation in COmputing REsearch (iCORE) lab](https://icore.tamucc.edu/), 
as well as the broader GSCS/CS programs at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi and whatever else might interest that community. 

**Next meeting:** Thursday, November 17, 3:30 pm at the NRC 2100 Suite

- We will start with a practice dissertation proposal defense by Abhishek Phadke. Support Abhishek by providing feedback for his upcoming proposal seminar. 
- Several undergrad students have expressed interest in iCORE. This is a good opportunity to learn more about what we do here and discuss ways to get involved.

## News

**Wen Zhong's successful proposal defense**

Yesterday (Nov. 11), Wen Zhong passed her dissertation proposal defense. Please congratulate her on her success. 
See last week's newsletter for her abstract. 

**Larissa Freguete's upcoming thesis defense**

Next Tuesday, Nov. 15, Larissa Marques Freguete will defend her master's thesis in the Geospatial Systems Engineering program. 
The defense will take place at 2:00pm in CI 113. 

Title: Evaluation of UAS-Based Photobathymetry Techniques for Coastal Shallow Water Mapping 
Abstract: Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS)-based photobathymetry techniques are perceived as a solution for a more flexible, cost-effective, time-consistent, and spatially denser bathymetric mapping in shallow coastal waters. These are emerging techniques, implemented by small UAS equipped with digital cameras, and have only started to be explored, so questions about their application capabilities remain to be answered. This study aims to compare the three main UAS photobathymetry techniques (video-based linear depth inversion, optical inversion, structure-from-motion/multi-view stereo (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry) and UAS-based bathymetric light detection and ranging (lidar) regarding their operational advantages and limitations. The comparison was based on a literature review and on the performance assessment of two conceptually opposing UAS photobathymetry techniques: video-based linear depth inversion using the cBathy algorithm and SfM-MVS photogrammetry referred to as UAS-SfM. Flight experiments were conducted over a wave-dominated sandy beach on Mustang Island, TX, for the evaluation of linear depth inversion and over wave-protected bayside areas of St. George Island, FL, and Mustang Island, TX. The flights over the bayside areas were set to evaluate the effect of camera orientation, solar elevation angle, and ground sample distance (GSD) on UAS-SfM performance. The cBathy algorithm provided a digital surface model (DSM) of the surf zone bathymetry with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.21 m. Performance of the UAS-SfM flight experiments varied by study site and flight design. The flight with a camera orientation of 30o off-nadir, orientated along the sun azimuth, at high solar elevation angle, and at an altitude of 100 m produced the most accurate bathymetric DSM with an RMSE of 0.15 m at the Florida study site. Based on the comparative field tests and literature review, this work’s ultimate contribution is a set of guidelines and recommendations for the operational use of the various UAS-based photobathymetry techniques.

## Upcoming events

**XAI workshop**

The XAI workshop will take place on Friday, Nov. 18 from 1:00 - 2:30pm. 
Originally, I was intending for it to truly be a workshop with the participants having to work and solve problems,
but I am changing the strategy. I expect that students may have very different backgrounds and skillsets and it will be very hard to make progress together in the 1.5-hour block. Instead, I am presenting a mix of slides and Jupyter notebooks demonstrations. 

1. Slides: Intro to XAI
2. Jupyter notebook: XAI for simple tabular models
3. Jupyter notebook: XAI for multi-channel geospatial raster models
4. Slides: XAI challenges / pitfalls
5. Slides: Our own work using XAI for the [FogNet](https://gridftp.tamucc.edu/fognet/) model


**SACNAS Beach Cleanup** 

The [TAMUCC SACNAS chapter](https://twitter.com/tamucc_sacnas) is hosting a beach cleanup at Padre Balli Park Beach on Saturday, November 19 2022 at 9:30-11:30am. [See the iEngage post for details.](https://tamucc.campuslabs.com/engage/event/8573331)
At least 2 iCORE members, Evan Krell and Mahmoud Eldefrawy, are planning to go. Let us know if you would like to join us. 


## Get involved

As always, we encourage all iCORE members and iCORE-adjacent persons to get involved and propose workshop/lecture/training ideas that they would like to present.
