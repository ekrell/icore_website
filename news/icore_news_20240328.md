The iCORE newsletter highlights events and information related to the [innovation in COmputing REsearch (iCORE) lab](https://icore.tamucc.edu/),
as well as the broader GSCS/CS programs at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi and whatever else might interest that community.
If you have any news or resources you would like to share, send an email to [Evan Krell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&hl=en) (ekrell@islander.tamucc.edu).

### Previous Meeting: March 22, 4:00 - 5:00 PM

**iCORE Event**

- **Topic:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- **Speaker:** [Dr. Sue Dettling](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/dettling)
- **When:** Friday, March 22, 4:00 - 5:00 PM
- **Where:** iCORE (NRC 2100 suite)

We had an excellent talk from Dr. Sue Dettling last week. 
Dr. Dettling develops software and machine learning models for the [Research
Applications Laboratory](https://ral.ucar.edu/) at NCAR. 
She shared with us her ongoing work in using Generatve Adversarial Networks (GANs) to increase the spatial resolution of gridded model outputs.
That is, the system can learn to estimate what the detailed, high-resolution data would look like when given a coarse, low-resolution input. 
An example is wind: it is possible to produce extremely detailed wind simulations where the wind interacts with buildings and topographical details. But, it takes hundreds of GPU hours to achieve. 
A much lower-resolution output can be generated very quickly, but without the fine-grained details of interest. 
So, ML is being used to quickly estimate the detailed high-resolution from the low-detail version. 
To learn more, see her [recent publication.](https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/8/1251/2023/)

## PhD Dissertation Defenses

### Marina Vicens-Miquel (March 27)

- Marina Vicens-Miquel has successfully defended her PhD in the GSCS program!
- She is part of [AI2ES](https://www.ai2es.org/) and the [Coastal Dynamics Lab](https://www.coastaldynamicslab.org/).
- She uses AI for a variety of research works related to water level prediction.
- Including total water level: how far the water will reach up the the beach.
- Locally, this is of high importance to conservation of endangered sea turtles.
- She already has a post-doc at The University of Oklahoma, working under [Dr. Amy McGovern](https://www.ou.edu/coe/cs/people/faculty/amy-mcgovern).

### Abhishek Phadke (March 29)

- Abhishek Phadke will defend his PhD in the GSCS program **this Friday**.
- He is part of [GOAL](https://antoniomedrano.github.io/GOAL.html) in the [Conrad Blucher Institute](https://www.conradblucherinstitute.org/).
- His research focuses on resiliency in autonomous systems.
- Autonomous vehicles (e.g. drones) can work together on complex tasks, but the real-world can be a harsh environment.
- There are many problems: loss of communications, battery depletion, high winds...
- So Abhishek has been working on systems that take into account potential failures so that the system can continue working even when such issues arise.

## PhD Proposal Defenses

### Mahmoud Eldefrawy (March 18)

- Mahmoud Eldefrawy successfully defended his proposal in the GSCS program!
- His research is on smart agriculture: using machine learning and autonomous systems to improve agricultural efficiency.
- With a growing population and environmntal pressures, food availability will be a major challenge.
- There is a huge need to apply technology to increase yield at lower costs.
- Mahmoud is combining ML and photogrammetry to turn 2D aerial imagery into 3D recustructions of crops.
- This can be used to quickly count crops and monitor growth, among other benefits. 



## Evan Krell (March 7)

- Evan Krell successully defended his GSCS proposal.
- He also writes these newsletters, so he doesn't want to make a big deal of it.
- We use complex ML models and we don't know how they work... but what if we did?
- Explainable AI (XAI) is a broad class of techniques that help us peer into these models: what strategies did the model learn?
- But Evan (1) showed that XAI for geospatial model is really hard and (2) has ideas on how to improve it.
- He also had good snacks.
