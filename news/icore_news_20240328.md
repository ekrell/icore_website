The iCORE newsletter highlights events and information related to the [innovation in COmputing REsearch (iCORE) lab](https://icore.tamucc.edu/),
as well as the broader GSCS/CS programs at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi and whatever else might interest that community.
If you have any news or resources you would like to share, send an email to [Evan Krell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&hl=en) (ekrell@islander.tamucc.edu).

### Previous Meeting: March 22, 4:00 - 5:00 PM

**iCORE Event**

- **Topic:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- **Speaker:** [Dr. Sue Dettling](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/dettling)
- **When:** Friday, March 22, 4:00 - 5:00 PM
- **Where:** iCORE (NRC 2100 suite)

We had an excellent talk from Dr. Sue Dettling last week. 
Dr. Dettling develops software and machine learning models for the [Research
Applications Laboratory](https://ral.ucar.edu/) at NCAR. 
She shared with us her ongoing work in using Generatve Adversarial Networks (GANs) to increase the spatial resolution of gridded model outputs.
That is, the system can learn to estimate what the detailed, high-resolution data would look like when given a coarse, low-resolution input. 
An example is wind: it is possible to produce extremely detailed wind simulations where the wind interacts with buildings and topographical details. But, it takes hundreds of GPU hours to achieve. 
A much lower-resolution output can be generated very quickly, but without the fine-grained details of interest. 
So, ML is being used to quickly estimate the detailed high-resolution from the low-detail version. 
To learn more, see her [recent publication.](https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/8/1251/2023/)
