Abstract

UAVs have become prevalent in applications related to surveying, military, and disaster relief, where their low cost, operational flexibility, 
and unmanned capabilities make them ideal for accomplishing tasks in areas deemed too dangerous or expensive for humans to enter. They can also 
accomplish high-cost and labor-intensive tasks such as land surveying more quickly and at lower cost. Researchers studying UAV applications have 
realized that a swarm of UAVs working collaboratively on tasks can achieve better and/or faster results. The dynamic work environment for single 
UAVs makes controlling them a challenge. This is magnified by using multiple agents in a swarm; thus, UAV swarms need to exhibit systemic resilience 
to disruptions. Resiliency is a broad concept that effectively defines how well a system handles disruption to normal function. The task of building 
resilient swarms has been attempted by researchers for more than a decade, but the complex challenge of achieving complete swarm resiliency means 
that it is still ongoing work.  

This study begins with an evaluation of current methods for incorporating resiliency in swarm systems. Using a systematic approach to identify and classify all operational and potentially vulnerable components of UAV swarms, our proposed solution is to build a comprehensive and ground-up resilient framework for node-based distributed systems that actively exhibits rapid self-preserving responses to unwanted stimuli. By using a modular approach to connect each recognized component, where each module integrates stepwise predefined schemes, learning-based and flexible response selection algorithms, the entire system is predicted to exhibit higher resiliency than current deployments. By expanding current swarm classification as homogeneous and multi-type heterogeneous swarms, further research directions such as exploring swarm dynamics with the inclusion of heterogeneous agents will also be evaluated. 

**New paper from Ismail Alihan Hadimlioglu**

The theme this week seems to be __resilience__: Alihan has published [A Decision Support Model for Improvement of Urban Resilience through Accessibility Analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365782746_A_Decision_Support_Model_for_Improvement_of_Urban_Resilience_through_Accessibility_Analysis) in the [International Journal of Environment and Geoinformatics (IJEGEO)](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/ijegeo)

**Transformers Short Course**

The [NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography (AI2ES)](https://www.ai2es.org/) is hosting a 4-part short course on transformers. A transformer is a deep learning architecture based heavily on the self-attention mechanism. While it has [achieved great success](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert) for dealing with sequence data for natural language processing tasks, this short course gives an overview of transformers in the context of environmental/atmospheric modeling. However, I believe that the principles are broadly relevant, especially to the geospatial CS community where we frequently deal with raster inputs of spatio-temporal data. All sessions are being recorded and are made available online. The last session (Wed, Nov. 30) is presented by a TAMUCC CS alumni: Hamid Kamangir. Hamid still works closely with TAMUCC, being part of the AI2ES coastal team and is the creator of [FogNet](https://gridftp.tamucc.edu/fognet/), a multiscale 3D CNN with double-branch dense block and attention mechanism for coastal fog prediction.

[Link to all AI2ES short courses.](https://www.ai2es.org/products/education/#shortcourses) They don't seem to have a link directly to individual courses, which is a problem for archival purposes. Right now, this link takes you to transformers being at the top. But after more courses are added, it will drift to the bottom. So I'll go ahead and replicate the details below:
