### Previous Meeting: April 12, 3:30 - 5:00 PM

Last meeting, we had a talk from [Dr. Monique Shotande](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Monique-Shotande) on probabilistic modeling. I was unable to be present, but I heard that it was a great talk!

### CANCELLED: Next Meeting: April 26, 3:30 - 5:00 PM

According to the event calendar, we have a meeting tomorrow (April 26) with a talk from Waylon Collins. 
However, this event has been cancelled so we are **not having our usual Friday meeting!**. 
However, we are collaborating with MSGSO to host a Python workshop tomorrow morning (see below). 

### iCORE + MSGSO Event: Intro to Python Workshop

![Event flyer](icore-msgso_python-workshop_spring2024.png)

iCORE and MSGSO are working together to present this Intro to Python workshop. The focus is on Python for _data science_, and assumes no previous Python experience. In this three-hour session, we will start from the absolute basics of Python and end by training a machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm. The workshop will introduce `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy` and other Python modules that are frequenty used for scientific computing. 

Please [RSVP here](https://tamucc.campuslabs.com/engage/event/10103109).
