The iCORE newsletter highlights events and information related to the [innovation in COmputing REsearch (iCORE) lab](https://icore.tamucc.edu/),
as well as the broader GSCS/CS programs at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi and whatever else might interest that community.

### Fall 2023 iCORE Event Calendar

![Event calendar](../img/icore_events_fall2023.png)

We have one more event before wrapping up the semester. Soon, we'll start thinking about next semester's events.

### Previous Meeting: December 1, 3:30 - 5:00 PM

Hector Marrero-Colominas, an undergraduate researcher in AI2ES, gave an excellent presentation on using probabilistic modeling to provide uncertainty estimates to stakeholders that rely on water temperature predictions for managing port traffic during cold-stunned sea turtle events in the Laguna Madre. This was followed by a good discussion about modeling, visualization, and designing systems to meet user's needs.
