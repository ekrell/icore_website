The iCORE newsletter highlights events and information related to the [innovation in COmputing REsearch (iCORE) lab](https://icore.tamucc.edu/),
as well as the broader GSCS/CS programs at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi and whatever else might interest that community.
If you have any news or resources you would like to share, send an email to [Evan Krell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&hl=en) (ekrell@islander.tamucc.edu).

## iCORE Meetings

**[iCORE Teams meeting link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3Ameeting_MDdlZDBiMTgtYzVjNS00YjhhLWE5OTctY2Y5YzMyYTljNzU5%40thread.v2/0?context=%7B%22Tid%22%3A%2234cbfaf1-67a6-4781-a9ca-514eb2550b66%22%2C%22Oid%22%3A%22994c008b-0707-4f3c-8ac0-73b65e733430%22%2C%22MessageId%22%3A%220%22%7D)**

### Next meeting: March 31, 2:00-4:00pm

- Mahmoud will present Part 2 of [_A Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning_](https://github.com/ekrell/icore_website/blob/main/news/icore_news_20230227.md)
- Part 2 will focus on code: how to use Python libraries to build and train models

### Future meeting: April 14, 2:00-4:00pm

- Meeting theme: _computer science in **your** domain_
- Seeking volunteers **outside CS** to share how they are using programming and CS in their research
- We are looking for short presentations (flexible on length)
- The goal is to share knowledge and find opportunities for collaboration 
  - CS students can learn how their knowledge can be applied to research in other fields
  - Non-CS can get potentially get feedback on techniques and tools they likely don't know about

So far we have one volunteer: Florian Morvais

## Weekly Snack Report

- For reasons outside the scope of the newsletter, Evan has been working remotely from Houston since mid-February
- So he is unable to monitor the state of iCORE snacks, and hopes that his lab-mates are eating well
- But Evan _has_ been taking advantage of the plentiful Chinese food: [click for an image gallery](https://photos.app.goo.gl/VHv1u7wzcgtSVLkp6)

Here are Evan's rankings, based on only one or two visits to each location:

1. [Jiu Fu](https://jiufucafehouston.com/): Excellent food! Specializes in Chaozhou (Chiu Chow) cuisine, so the menu is very different from the other Chinese restaurants around. They have congee and Chiu Chow-style omelettes. I am enamored with the [salty fish chicken eggplant clay pot](https://photos.app.goo.gl/hLo2UeYcJAqVK7k99) whose eggplants absorbed a wonderful oceanic flavor. I was finally able to try the [fried dough sticks](https://photos.app.goo.gl/q7a7iEDXkFcXKRYq8) that I have heard so much about. 
2. [Cooking Girl](https://www.thecookinggirls.com/): Spicy and delicious Szechuan food. I recommend the [malatang](https://photos.app.goo.gl/nEx3oPTTngnwdTFL8), even if I do not recognize all the components within.
3. [Mala Sichuan Bistro](https://malasichuan.com/): This restaurant is quite popular with several locations in the area. I am impressed with the wide array of menu items, but perhaps I didn't get the best things. The [three pepper beaten duck](https://photos.app.goo.gl/EDWD9x6nNL2TzrGD6) was very good, but the total amount of duck meat was low.
4. [Tiger Noodle House](https://tigernoodletexas.com/): I really liked my [shredded sweet garlic pork](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5bBD6Ekp2V3VZZXU8) , but the rice was the worst of the placest I've tried here.
5. [Trendy Dumpling](https://trendydumpling.com/): Hit and miss: I loved the [dan dan noodles](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9T6Di3CyrQML6AKq8), but the [chicken dumplings](https://photos.app.goo.gl/f9Rft1SLmxcUbvW19) were average at best. Also, I ordered a Honeydew Milk Tea that was good, but they filled it with so much ice that it was impossible to access the additions. So I had to eat the boba at the bottom after finishing the drink.

## Get involved

As always, we encourage all iCORE members and iCORE-adjacent persons to get involved and propose workshop/lecture/training ideas that they would like to present.
