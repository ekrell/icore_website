### Next meeting: March 31, 2:00-4:00pm

- Mahmoud will present Part 2 of [_A Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning_](https://github.com/ekrell/icore_website/blob/main/news/icore_news_20230227.md)
- Part 2 will focus on code: how to use Python libraries to build and train models

### Future meeting: April 14, 2:00-4:00pm

- Meeting theme: _computer science in **your** domain_
- Seeking volunteers **outside CS** to share how they are using programming and CS in their research
- We are looking for short presentations (flexible on length)
- The goal is to share knowledge and find opportunities for collaboration 
  - CS students can learn how their knowledge can be applied to research in other fields
  - Non-CS can get potentially get feedback on techniques and tools they likely don't know about

- **When:** October 26 – 28
- **Funding:**
  - There may be opportunities to be funded through the local SACNAS Chapter, **but nothing guaranteed**
  - But to be eligible for funding through TAMUCC, last year you needed to have done the following:

    2. Apply to [present a poster or talk](https://www.sacnas.org/conference/research-presentations)
- We'll keep you posted on the details, but if you are interested at all, go ahead and apply for both presenting and travel funds 
- Send questions to **Roy Roberts** (`roy.roberts@tamucc.edu`), TAMUCC SACNAS Chapter President

Last year, iCORE member Evan Krell attended the NDISTEM conference in Puerto Rico and it was a very good experience. 


## Get involved

As always, we encourage all iCORE members and iCORE-adjacent persons to get involved and propose workshop/lecture/training ideas that they would like to present.
