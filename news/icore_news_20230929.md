## Welcome

![Evan's rental bicycle in front of CIRA sign](../img/welcome_cira.jpg)

Greetings from Ft. Collins, Colorado. I, Evan, am writing this newsletter from my temporary desk at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA).
I am spending a month in Colorado for research. First, I spent a week in Boulder to attend two conferences that I'll report on below. I then transferred to an AirBnB in Ft. Collins where I'm spending the remaining three weeks doing research with Dr. Imme Ebert-Uphoff. I am working on my dissertation research related to addressing challenges in applying explainable AI (XAI) techniques to geoscience models that use gridded spatial data inputs. The above image shows that I managed the ~9-mile ride to CIRA using my rental bike.  

## iCORE Meetings

**[iCORE Teams meeting link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3Ameeting_MDdlZDBiMTgtYzVjNS00YjhhLWE5OTctY2Y5YzMyYTljNzU5%40thread.v2/0?context=%7B%22Tid%22%3A%2234cbfaf1-67a6-4781-a9ca-514eb2550b66%22%2C%22Oid%22%3A%22994c008b-0707-4f3c-8ac0-73b65e733430%22%2C%22MessageId%22%3A%220%22%7D)**

- I was not at the meeting, or at least I was trying not to be at the meeting. 
- It likely went over general updates and planning for the Google visit that took place on the 26th.
- I had just gotten out of a conference and was soon to travel from Boulder to Ft. Collins.
- In the meantime, I was relaxing with some tea at [Ku Cha](https://www.kuchatea.com/).
- While trying to enjoy my tea, I got a text from Dr. King that no one but me could start the Teams meeting.
- As usual, I had to save the day since iCORE can't function 5 minutes without me.

### Next Meeting: October 6

- 3:30pm - 4:00pm: iCORE member updates
- 4:00pm - 5:00pm **Event: Machine Learning Talk: Optimizing Hyperparameters** (description below)

## Upcoming Events

### Machine Learning Talk: Optimizing Hyperparameters

- Speaker: Brian Colburn, (undergraduate research assistant in the [Coastal Dynamics Lab](https://www.coastaldynamicslab.org/) & [AI2ES](https://www.ai2es.org/)
- He is working on a coastal fog prediction model using variational autoencoders
- Over the past year, he has worked extensively with hyperparameter tuning systems
- He is willing to share some of these insights and strategies
