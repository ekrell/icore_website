## Welcome

![Evan's rental bicycle in front of CIRA sign](../img/welcome_cira.jpg)

Greetings from Ft. Collins, Colorado. I, Evan, am writing this newsletter from my temporary desk at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA).
I am spending a month in Colorado for research. First, I spent a week in Boulder to attend two conferences that I'll report on below. I then transferred to an AirBnB in Ft. Collins where I'm spending the remaining three weeks doing research with Dr. Imme Ebert-Uphoff. I am working on my dissertation research related to addressing challenges in applying explainable AI (XAI) techniques to geoscience models that use gridded spatial data inputs. The above image shows that I managed the ~9-mile ride to CIRA using my rental bike.
