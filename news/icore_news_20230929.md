## Welcome

![Evan's rental bicycle in front of CIRA sign](../img/welcome_cira.jpg)

Greetings from Ft. Collins, Colorado. I, Evan, am writing this newsletter from my temporary desk at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA).
I am spending a month in Colorado for research. First, I spent a week in Boulder to attend two conferences that I'll report on below. I then transferred to an AirBnB in Ft. Collins where I'm spending the remaining three weeks doing research with Dr. Imme Ebert-Uphoff. I am working on my dissertation research related to addressing challenges in applying explainable AI (XAI) techniques to geoscience models that use gridded spatial data inputs. The above image shows that I managed the ~9-mile ride to CIRA using my rental bike.  

## iCORE Meetings

### Previous Meeting: September 22, 3:30 - 5:30

![ku cha](../img/kucha.JPG)

- I was not at the meeting, or at least I was trying not to be at the meeting. 
- It likely went over general updates and planning for the Google visit that took place on the 26th.
- I had just gotten out of a conference and was soon to travel from Boulder to Ft. Collins.
- In the meantime, I was relaxing with some tea at [Ku Cha](https://www.kuchatea.com/).
- While trying to enjoy my tea, I got a text from Dr. King that no one but me could start the Teams meeting.
- As usual, I had to save the day since iCORE can't function 5 minutes without me.

### Next Meeting: October 6

- 3:30pm - 4:00pm: iCORE member updates
- 4:00pm - 5:00pm: **Event: Machine Learning Talk: Optimizing Hyperparameters** (description below)
