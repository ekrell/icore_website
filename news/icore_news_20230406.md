### Previous meeting: 

- Mahmoud Eldefrawy finished up his 2-part series [_A Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning_](https://github.com/ekrell/icore_website/blob/main/news/icore_news_20230227.md).
- Soon, we will make all of the Jupyter Notebooks available that Mahmoud presented.
- We had good attendance and many great questions for Mahmoud, so thanks to all who came.

### Next meeting: April 14, 2:00-4:00pm

**Meeting Theme**: _computer science + domain expertise**

- The purpose of these meeting is to share experiences where computer science has been applied to other fields.
- Seeking volunteers who are either:
  1. **outside CS** to share how they are using programming and CS in their research.
  2. **inside CS** who have worked with domain experts to solve problems that required their expertise
- The goal is to share knowledge and find opportunities for collaboration 
  - CS students can learn how their knowledge can be applied to research in other fields
  - Non-CS can get potentially get feedback on techniques and tools they likely don't know about

## Tech Tips

### Monitor your processes

- This week, there was a bit of an incident with the TAMUCC _deep learning_ server. 
- Suddenly, jobs were running _veeeeeery_ slowly. Why?
- Remember, when you spawn a batch of processes, they are not always killed just because you terminated the program that spawned them.
- For example, consider a script `run_experiments.sh` that launches 5 machine learning training runs.
- If I am debugging this script, I might run it and kill it a large number of times: each time spawning 5 more!
- As each one uses up more memory, none can make any progress and the machine grinds to a halt.
- It is critical to make sure that the **spawned processes are also killed!**
- In this case, the person thought that they had 0 running jobs, but in fact had over 200: each using up amost 2 GB of memory!

How to monitor running processes:

The first column has the process ID or PID. You can use this number to kill processes. 

How to kill a process using a PID:

    kill -9 PID

How to kill a range of processes:

    kill -9 {PID1..PID2}      # e.g.   kill -9 {10..20}

- Make sure to kill only processes that should be killed. 
- Thankfully, you only have permission to kill processes that you own, so mine are safe if you use the wrong PID

## Weekly Snack Report

- Since Evan is still in Houston, he has continued to explore everything edible in Houston's Chinatown. 
- Despite the name, it is as much a Vietnamese town as Chinese. There is a _Hong Kong Mall_ that is almost exclusively Vietnamese establishments.
