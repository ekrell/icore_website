## Other TAMU-CC CS Events

Part of iCORE is to promote computer science at TAMUCC in general, and we encourage iCORE members to attend and support student research presentations. Marina Vicens Miquel, a PhD student in the Geospatial Computer Science program, is defending her dissertation proposal tomorrow.
The presentation will take place Monday, October 24, 2022 at 3:30 pm in CI 138.  

Marina is a member of the NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography (AI2ES) and is specifically part of the AI2ES Coastal Oceanography sub-group along with others from the Conrad Blucher Institute. Marina's research is to use artificial intelligence for modeling potential coastal inundation. Ultimately, the goal is to predict how far up the beach the water will reach some hours in advance. Such a model will incorporate a number of predictors, but a very important one is the current line along the beach where the water reaches: the wet/dry shoreline. However, manually measuring the wet/dry shoreline requires substantial human effort, and the goal is to create an automated forecasting system applicable for large shoreline extent.
