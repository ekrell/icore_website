### Laguna Madre Rookery Island Cleanup

Yesterday morning, iCORE members Mahmoud Eldefrawy and Evan Krell volunteered to assist with the [Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program annual Laguna Madre Rookery Island Cleanup](https://www.facebook.com/CBBEPCoastalBirds/posts/pfbid0gS1JrFHmMnGgoWmDibaKYLKEBAHX61F1cnF3gZS6QeACUUsZEEiyMPnaA16s9v6zl?__cft__[0]=AZUdVUqlEdla5JtstV4LYOcHnZVGEkLDnRCASxVAuJKsgzffvSZD940k-kefh75s8sGPAONeQFotbJYs3OYsS075fm0U84hGS1PRvvgVKC2rnKhlpmDgx_PDuocC872Cn5J_-aDixNrDWz21GBshs1mIBsL-I-40MZNIIS-ocgvyDSuXR5iTrhq3ZMLvbam6_rtuDpJifpwrM1uJeE0D8CtD&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R). Those familiar with the Laguna Madre are aware of the many spoil islands along its channels. Dredging the channels yields mounds of dirt that can be used as protected habitat for nesting birds. Boaters will be familiar with the yellow signs that warn against approaching and disturbing the residents. However, the end of nesting season is an opportunity to remove trash from their island homes. Several boats departed from Doc's to spread out and clean up the islands. Of particular concern is discarded fishing line; we found one bird carcass that had been completely entangled.

The morning proved surprisingly successful for networking. The only volunteers representing computer science, we exchanged contacts with several groups interested in working with us on projects or at least getting an idea of how they could leverage recent computer science advancements. Computer vision came up repeatedly. For example, to detect specimens that appear in trailcam footage. On the subject of autonomous vehicles, one group described the need for an autonomous marine robot to map out seagrasses in the Laguna Madre. I was discussing my interest in using deep learning to classify seagrass species, but I learned that even a classifier that just detects the presence of any seagrass is greatly needed. iCORE has already done some work in this area, but the project is currently dormant. We have access to an [autonomous surface vessel](https://ekrell.github.io/success/) that is equipped with both underwater camera and [dive light](https://ekrell.github.io/light-test/). We have several hours of [shallow-water video recordings](https://youtu.be/HfisJm9n5yk) that are waiting to be used to train machine learning classifiers. Initial results showed some promise in being able to generate a seagrass presence map, but much work needs to be done to make the system robust to varying light conditions, depth, and turbidity. This is a challenging computer vision problem, but would be a great experience for interested students to work on.

### SACNAS: National Diversity In STEM Conference (NDiSTEM)

Evan Krell is presenting a poster at [NDiSTEM which will take place from October 27 â€“ 29 in San Juan, Puerto Rico](https://www.sacnas.org/conference). The poster is an updated version of that which was presented at the [2022 Spring Student Research Symposium](https://www.tamucc.edu/research/research-symposium/index.php). The poster, _The influence of grouping features on explainable artificial intelligence for a complex fog prediction deep learning model_, showcases current work using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques to explain a [complex deep learning model for coastal fog prediction](https://gridftp.tamucc.edu/fognet/). The previous version of the poster is available at the [TAMU-CC Repository](https://tamucc-ir.tdl.org/handle/1969.6/90558). The new version will include updated experimental results and visualizations that more clearly demonstrate what the XAI techniques reveal about the model's behavior. 

### Marina Vicens Miquel's Research Proposal Seminar: Coastal Inundation Prediction Using Deep Learning

We encourage iCORE members to attend and support computer-related student research presentations. [Marina Vicens Miquel](https://marinavicensmiquel.github.io/), a PhD student in the Geospatial Computer Science program, is defending her dissertation proposal tomorrow. The presentation will take place Monday, October 24, 2022 at 3:30 pm in CI 138.  

Marina is a member of the [NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography (AI2ES)](https://www.ai2es.org/) and is specifically part of the AI2ES Coastal Oceanography sub-group along with others from the Conrad Blucher Institute. Marina's research is to use artificial intelligence for modeling potential coastal inundation. Ultimately, the goal is to predict how far up the beach the water will reach some hours in advance. Such a model will incorporate a number of predictors, but a very important one is the current line along the beach where the water reaches: the wet/dry shoreline. However, manually measuring the wet/dry shoreline requires substantial human effort, and the goal is to create an automated forecasting system applicable for large shoreline extent. Thus, a first step is automatic detection of the wet/dry shoreline from imagery. This is a very challenging computer vision problem: it is sometimes quite difficult even for the human to identify the separation. Marina has made substantial progress in developing deep learning models for wet/dry shoreline detection. An interesting aspect of her work is the verification. The output of the model is a shoreline drawn on the image. Simple pixel-wise verification metrics may not meaningfully capture model accuracy. This problem influenced Marina's approach in both how the target is defined and performance evaluated. Students interested in computer vision, deep learning, and spatial data should find something of interest. Please come support Marina if you are available.
