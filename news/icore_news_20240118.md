The iCORE newsletter highlights events and information related to the [innovation in COmputing REsearch (iCORE) lab](https://icore.tamucc.edu/),
as well as the broader GSCS/CS programs at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi and whatever else might interest that community.
If you have any news or resources you would like to share, send an email to [Evan Krell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&hl=en) (ekrell@islander.tamucc.edu).

### Next Meeting: January 19, 3:00PM - 5:00PM

- **Event:** Evan Krell's practice lecture for [AMS Short Course: Machine Learning in Python for Environmental Science Problems]([Machine Learning in Python for Environmental Science Problems](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/education-careers/careers/professional-development/short-courses/machine-learning-in-python-for-environmental-science-problems2/))

## Upcoming Events

### Machine Learning Talk: Meteorological Model Interpretation

- Title: Application of XAI methods to a 3D Convolutional Neural Network Fog Prediction Model: Meteorological Interpretations of Output
- Speaker: [Waylon Collins](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Waylon-Collins)
- When: Friday, Dec. 8, 4:00 - 5:00 PM
- Where: iCORE (NRC 2100 suite)

Frequent iCORE visitors are sure to have heard of [FogNet, a complex deep learning model for coastal fog prediction](https://gridftp.tamucc.edu/fognet/) by [Hamid Kamangir](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YLYJGQ8AAAAJ&hl=en). Evan Krell has used FogNet as a case study to explore eXplainable AI techniques. This study has been accepted in [Environmental Data Science](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science). [Waylon Collins](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Waylon-Collins) is a meteorologist from the National Weather Service who has been instrumental throughout the FogNet project, from selecting the input features to analyzing the results of the XAI techniques. In this talk, Waylon Collins will present his meteorological interpretation of the FogNet model. Waylon has been using neural networks for environmental science problems [for over fifteen years](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Waylon-Collins/publication/237725662_137_USE_OF_THE_NCEP_MESOETA_DATA_IN_A_WATER_LEVEL_PREDICTING_NEURAL_NETWORK/links/581cf2ba08ae40da2cab3ce3/137-USE-OF-THE-NCEP-MESOETA-DATA-IN-A-WATER-LEVEL-PREDICTING-NEURAL-NETWORK.pdf). This should be an interesting talk for many of you since Waylon connects the AI modeling to domain expertise. 













## Get involved

As always, we encourage all iCORE members and iCORE-adjacent persons to get involved and propose workshop/lecture/training ideas that they would like to present.
