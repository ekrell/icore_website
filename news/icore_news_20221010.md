# iCORE Newsletter - 2022/10/10

## News

1. Last Monday, a group of iCORE alumni working at USAA stopped by to say hello and take a quick tour. We were lucky that our demo stations were still set up from the Open House, which made us look very prepared.

2. Please congratulate Wen Zhong on her new publication: Integrated coastal subsidence analysis using InSAR, LiDAR, and land cover data

3. We have been uploading videos to the iCORE Youtube account. Those at the Open House have already seen these.

## Previous events

1. Last Thursday, Evan Krell gave a lecture in using Python for Geospatial Plotting in Dr. King's Data Analytics class. Material included plotting static points, working with NetCDF data, animated time series maps, and interactive maps that can be saved as HTML pages.
You can find the Jupyter Notebook that Evan went over here: https://github.com/ekrell/python-geo-plots

2. At last Thursday's iCORE meeting, Evan Krell gave a quick tutorial on using Inkscape to produce vector graphics for publication. Material covered how to use many of the most important tools, setting up your canvas, and properly exporting the file based on what you want to do with it. This was followed by a brief example of making an algorithm flowchart. It was a very casual presentation: very interactive with discussion throughout.

## Upcoming iCORE events

Evan Krell is giving a Linux workshop on Fri 10/14/2022 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM. The workshop will be located at iCORE (NRC, 2100 Suite). This is motivated by people frequently asking Evan Linux questions. The Linux course I taught was aimed at cyber security students who need a deep understanding of Linux administration. Here, I am focusing on researchers using Linux resources. For example:

1. How do I stop my running process from dying when I log out (intentionally or otherwise)?
2. Effectively use the package manager
3. Install (some) software without admin
4. Working with SSH keys
5. Using Jupyter notebooks inside a server
6. Using groups to collaborate within Linux (as opposed to giving everything read+write+execute like I usually see people do...)
7. A little bit of scripting
8. And if we are up for it, one of my favorite topics: parallel scripting

## Get involved

You might notice that many of the events are "Evan Krell presented". This is time that he could be either (1) researching, (2) fishing, or (3) sailing.
We encourage all iCORE members and iCORE-adjacent persons to get involved and propose workshop/lecture/training ideas that they would like to present so that Evan can get a break!
