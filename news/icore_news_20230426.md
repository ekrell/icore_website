### Next meeting: April 28, 2:00-4:00pm

**No event:** this is a great opportunity for anyone interested in working with iCORE to make a plan for how you can get involved. 
Summer is a great time for undergrads to start their research.

- General updates
- Plans for next semester: workshops, etc
- We need to update the iCORE website
- We need a protocol for documenting finished projects (or project milestones)

(iCORE is weird because it is sometimes ambiguous whether or not you are a member. Usually a member is someone who has Dr. King on their committee or oversees their research in some way. But, for example, I listed Florian as a member since he goes to most iCORE meetings. I guess at some point you are around here so often that you are a member.)


## Get involved

As always, we encourage all iCORE members and iCORE-adjacent persons to get involved and propose workshop/lecture/training ideas that they would like to present.
