### iCORE Alumni Alexis Guijarro mentored a team for the Mexican Robotics Tournament 2023

Alexis Guijarro has mentored his team SkyForce at the Mexican Robotics Tournament 2023 which took place in Xalapa, Mexico. As part of the autonomous drone challenges, SkyForce competed with other teams to complete tests such as obstacle avoidance, moving through loops, navigation by waypoints, autonomous landing, and 3D scanning. At the end of this event, Alexis' team ended in 6th place and he believes that current team members are on track for better results next year. Alongside these challenges, other categories were present: Unmanned Ground Vehicles for disasters, Autonomous cars, LEGO® and Home Robots.

**We love to see iCORE alumni sharing their great work with us!**
