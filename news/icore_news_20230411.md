### Abhishek Phadke wins 3rd place in Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition

- [3MT](https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/) is a challenge to present your research to a broad audience in under 3 minutes.
- This competition was developed by The University of Queensland (UQ) to facilitate researcher's communication skills.
- The TAMUCC 3MT competition is organized by [G.R.O.W.](https://www.tamucc.edu/grad-college/grow/index.php), and took place last Thursday (3/6).

### Next meeting: April 14, 2:00-4:00pm

**Schedule**

| **Time**    | **Subject** | **Description** |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| 2:00 - 2:30 | Updates | iCORE members share 1-minute updates. Then, a general discussion time before the event. |
| 2:30 - 4:00 | Event   | Computer Science + Domain Expertise (see below). | 

**Event: computer science + domain expertise**

- Build collaborations: connect CS & non-CS students to solve problems using AI, HPC, and other technologies.
- This event is a sequence of short presentations about using computer technologies to solve domain problems.
- **Seeking non-CS volunteers** to show how they are using or planning to use computer science in their research.
  - CS students can learn about opportunities to apply their knowledge.
  - Non-CS students can get feedback and ideas from a CS perspective.
- Volunteers should prepare 8-15 minute talks in the form of slides, posters, videos, etc.
